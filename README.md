Hello!

I designed and coded a meditation timer. The app has a landing page, instructions page for proposed functionality and the main page where the timer countdown is installed. The timer works as follows: when pressing play, an audio bell is sounded and the main image become animated in a gentle pulse until time 0, at that moment the audio is played again and the top title shift. The timer is reset.
Also, it is responsive and looks great on mobiles. It was a completely independent project that I am very proud of.
